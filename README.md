# Blue Dots Drawing Website

## Description

The **Blue Dots Drawing Website** is an interactive web page that allows users to generate random blue circles across the screen and draw freely on the canvas using their mouse. The page uses D3.js to create dynamic and visually appealing graphics, combining randomly generated circles with a freehand drawing feature using blue strokes.

This project demonstrates how JavaScript, HTML, and CSS can be used together to create a unique and engaging web experience, blending random graphic generation with user-drawn elements.

## Features

- **Random Blue Circles**: Press the `Spacebar` to generate random sets of blue circles across the screen.
- **Freehand Drawing**: Click and drag the mouse to draw on the screen. The drawing stroke will be in blue.
- **Clear Design**: Simple and clean layout with responsive SVG container filling the entire viewport.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styles the webpage and makes the SVG container responsive.
- **JavaScript (D3.js)**: Handles the random circle generation and freehand drawing feature.

## Instructions

### How to Use the Website

1. **Generate Random Blue Circles**:
   - Press the `Spacebar` on your keyboard.
   - A set of blue circles will randomly appear on the screen each time you press the `Spacebar`.
   - There is no limit to how many times you can generate circles.

2. **Freehand Drawing**:
   - Click and hold the left mouse button anywhere on the screen.
   - Drag the mouse while holding the button to draw a blue stroke.
   - Release the mouse button to stop drawing.
   - You can draw freely across the entire SVG canvas.

### Controls

- **Spacebar**: Generate a random set of blue circles.
- **Mouse Click & Drag**: Draw freehand with a blue stroke on the screen.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the webpage, including the SVG container for circles and drawing.
- **styles.css**: Styles the page, ensuring the SVG fills the entire viewport.
- **script.js**: JavaScript logic that handles the random circle generation and the freehand drawing feature.

## Installation and Setup

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start interacting with the webpage by following the instructions above.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a feature to change the color of the drawing stroke dynamically.
- Implement an option to clear the screen or erase specific elements.
- Include additional shapes or patterns for random generation.
